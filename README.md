# Anti-Flag for Overwatch

**Anti-Flag** is a simply Console Application written in modern C++. It prevents Chainban's by clearing common Directories and Registry Keys, which Blizzard and Cheat Developers use to *Flag* your Device if you either were a Bad Boy >:( or downloaded malware disguised as Overwatch Cheats.

## How to Use ?

Just run it, thats it really. 

## How to Build ?

Simple, **Clone the Repository** and **open the Solution**, *you may need some SDK's as we are using C++ Version 17*.
To actually *Build* the Project all you have to do is select the **Release Configuration** and... well... *build it*.

## Why ?

As Blizzard keeps getting more aggressive with Bans, we have decide to make this Public in an effort to stop them from blindly flailing a shotgun around and taking out every Account that may just show the *slightest* signs of being either Cheated on or being Botted by a Levelling Script. 

## Credits

## License

We have decided to put this Project under **Public Domain**!
